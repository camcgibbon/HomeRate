# HomeRate
## Introduction
There are numerous apartments spread throughout campus, but itâ€™s hard to determine if the location of the apartment is a right fit. HomeRate is a website that provides ratings for the accessibility of the apartment in multiple categories, allowing for UIUC students to find a location that works for them. Students can enter in a potential apartment address, and a map of hte apartment and surroundings will be provided, with walking ratings from the address to restaurants, bus stops, and classes.

## Technical Architecture
Frontend - Landing page, Search page and Contact page: UI elements implemented using HTML and CSS. Forms are implemented using JavaScript.

Backend - User input from the Search page is processed using Flask. The corresponding map image and the various ratings are then displayed on the website using the GoogleMaps API
